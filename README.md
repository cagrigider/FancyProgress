# FancyProgress

ðŸŒŸToday almost all apps have the same progress views. Progress views or loading screens are fundamental, users should not get bored while waiting for a network call or a data loading. That's why I created the FancyProgress. By using the FancyProgress feature we can have different loading animations. FancyProgress will be updated over time according to requests from users. 
 
 Waiting for your feedbacks... Happy Coding!!ðŸ™‚
